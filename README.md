# Receipts for Lovely Loveseats Project

## Part of 'Learn Python 3 - Codecademy Projects'

I have written a Python program designed for a small-business that sells furniture 'Lovely Loveseats'. This program builds a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for customers, storing the names and prices for the furniture items in variables. It will then process the total price and item list for the customers, printing them to the output terminal.
